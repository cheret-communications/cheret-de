Elevator pitch One of the most important ways to brand yourself and let people know what you do is your elevator pitch. So how do you make sure you can get your message across the right way? How can you start raking in those requests to be hired by the right people you can help best?</description></item><item><title>Branding through events (Networking Series Part 4)</title><link>https://cheret.de/2016/10/branding-through-events-networking-series-part-4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2016 21:58:58 +0000</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.de/2016/10/branding-through-events-networking-series-part-4/</guid><description>The types of events you attend shape your personal branding.
