As a **Dominant** in your D/s type of play, you already put a huge amount of **care and consideration** into creating a **safe, sane and consensual** scene for your submissive with the intent to **lead to deeper pleasure** and explore boundaries and push them ever so slightly for growth. The growth of both Dominant and submissive. There is a perceived discomfort in going further and this is the exploration and negotiation between the two that leads to more depth.

You lead your submissive and they want you to take them "two steps" further than you planned.
