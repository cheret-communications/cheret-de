The act of creation is the manifestation of invisible potential into actual tangible reality.

<!--more-->

Creativity is the continued repetition of acts of creation.

The creative process is a proven and working formula.

It all starts with invisible and intangible potential. The creative mind now theorises and visualises. It forms thoughts and lends words to the previously unspeakable. The creative speaks potential into existence using words and sketches. Planning, drafting, scripting and organising. Prototyping, testing and building.

Thusly, which once wasn't, it now is.
