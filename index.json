I’m publishing this article here on my coaching website as I’m convinced that practices and values present in the BDSM community can help a leader in this modern world grasp fundamental knowledge about humans and leadership and gain valuable insights into behaviour and dynamics, even if they don’t know much about BDSM or don’t want to practice it themselves. As a Dominant in your D/s type of play, you already put a huge amount of care and consideration into creating a safe, sane and consensual scene for your submissive with the intent to lead to deeper pleasure and explore boundaries and push them ever so slightly for growth. The growth of both Dominant and submissive. There is a perceived discomfort in going further and this is the exploration and negotiation between the two that leads to more depth.

Go two steps further than you feel comfortable with The exercise and art form now becomes to seek discomfort for growth and pleasure using full force of “dom confidence” and lead into the unknown white spots on your map and plant your flag there. A land to be discovered together while drawing the map. The submissive needs to surrender and trust and listen to their body. From personal experience and conversation I know that the element of trust needs to propagate from heart to mind to body. So even if your submissive’s decision and feeling of trust is present, the body/limbic brain needs more time to adjust and neural pathways need to extend to control the fight/flight/freeze response ensuring instinctive survival. It’s an intricate process of reprogramming to translate the experience of being controlled and pain (on the submissive’s side) into a physical mode of safety and pleasure provided by the Dominant. It’s also a fundamental dynamic that is being played with here. The triggering of the fight/flight/freeze response is responsible for the adrenaline rush. Arriving at safety gives you endorphins. Thus deep bonding occurs.

In my thinking this colour red was something that I tried to avoid at all costs in fear of breaking something. If you imagine your Domination comfort zone as a staircase, your red and your submissive’s red are both very close to the start of the staircase to begin with. For those new to the BDSM practice and also for those well experienced, red is an ever moving target and different in any D/s play relationships, and can progress a step up with every scene played. In my experience, the Dominant’s green edging on yellow is their comfort zone and your submissive’s yellow didn’t even start, yet. So in order to play a scene that provides a satisfying experience for your submissive, you need to suss out and operate in your submissive’s yellow zone, which might be in your red. With the Dominant’s red being the aformentioned fear of breaking something. Of course all of this is an ongoing dialogue as I’m sure you appreciate that BDSM in general requires a very communicative environment to be sane. What popular culture displays as BDSM is at times far from safe, sane and consensual.

We have been trained to embrace mediocrity over choosing excellence1. Here are some examples of how softening the blow or the famous bullshit sandwich when giving feedback has made it into our everyday colloquial verbiage. Any time you hear words like these in sentences, you immediately know that this is not powerful: kind of, sort of a little hopefully, maybe just an idea just kidding (after expressing intuitive truth) everyone (generalisation when talking about personal experience) Unconscious language is also used to state what you don’t want, completely omitting what you want instead. This is not productive. If you express yourself screaming you just gave away your power. An unnecessarily loud voice doesn’t lend power to the content of what you have to say. On the contrary. If you look yourself in the mirror at that moment, you notice your likeness to a little kid on the floor screaming and crying to get candy in the supermarket. The same goes for aggression or passive aggressive demeanour. It is the behaviour of wounded souls. Forbidding or limiting someone in their freedom or putting them (or yourself) down isn’t powerful either. It is a sign of weakness and projection of shame. The associated feeling is jealousy, insecurity or a low sense of self-worth. The unconscious are insecure, manipulative and controlling. The unconscious deny the existence of the powerful or take their existence as a personal attack. The unconscious emphasise activity over the state of being. The unconscious complain about what they can’t control and avoid taking responsibility for what they can control. The unconscious have weak boundaries and they withdraw, avoid or play the victim card or over-emotionalise when their boundaries are breached.

In our daily experience, it is all too natural to want to avoid pain. It is not pleasurable to feel pain. The mechanisms we have been trained with (especially psychologically) is the denial. Take a parent telling their kid to stop crying. This stems from a pain avoidance learned and instilled. I for one believe that the avoidance of pain is ultimately huge cruelty towards yourself and others.5 In order to heal a wound, it needs treatment. How can you be able to treat a wound if you deny its existence? Or lie to yourself about the actual size and depth of the wound. Or tell yourself that it’s not that important and best to treat other’s people’s wounds first. As a therapy, you can choose the quick win of a superficial treatment with a little patch to soothe the soul or the road less travelled. Which is identifying the root cause of this pain. It all starts with your choice to address those topics and ask your body and mind (conscious, unconscious and subconscious) to be with you and support you in the process. Here are some affirmations that you can speak to yourself to get started: I am capable of transforming negative experiences into something positive. I am worthy of respect and equality. Everything works out for my highest good. I am opening my heart and learn to trust again. I am rational, balanced and know my truth. I speak my truth, even if my voice shakes. It’s okay to not be okay. Every emotion is legitimate. I let myself be happy, sad, frustrated and hurt. This is my experience, and I am accepting it. Each day, I am creating a more meaningful life. I am changing in positive ways. I am making peace with my past and accepting myself. I make healthy choices and choose to love myself every day. My life is divinely guided. I am exactly where I need to be on my journey. I am safe at this moment. Today, I choose to focus on the things I can control. My needs and wants are just as important as anyone else’s.

I don’t even know where to begin describing how the European Academy inspired me. I’ll pick a highlight and leave some of the rest to future articles for me to write. I put this piece together about how important it is to bring value to a network first. One of the most inspiring moments during the Academy for me was when it was announced that I had been named the “Best Delegate” out of 97 graduates from 24 European countries. Walking up on stage, it was the first time in ten years that my knees shook and I didn’t know what to do. This moment had such a profound impact on me. It felt like everything I had invested in JCI and the other delegates up until this point came back to me in an amplified way. Receiving this recognition put me in the spotlight, made me feel seen and filled me with immense pride. It is one of the results of the inspiration the Academy brings that I don’t need to hide behind false humility. I’m enabled to realise that a team of world-class trainers had made their decision (and an insensitive one I presume) and they chose me. Who am I to argue with the combined wisdom and experience of thousands of training hours among a hand-picked group of outstanding trainers.

What inspired me most and confirmed my belief in the “behind the scenes” culture of storytelling and showing that the world doesn’t only consist of events but mainly of processes leading up to events, is their meticulously crafted series of videos leading up to the big reveal of showing the world their marble machine. This musical instrument made it into the Speelklok Museum in Utrecht. What you want to catch up with is the design and build of the follow up to the original Marble Machine called “Marble Machine X” which they started a video series on in 2017: Building Marble Machine X - All Episodes in One Playlist And yes, this is the second time that Wintergatan is featured on my inspirations of the year posts. What is inspiration? Inspiration is the process of being mentally stimulated to do or feel something, especially to do something creative.

In my last project the business owner thought he would attract males 40+. Using analytics data we realized the true potential lies with an audience of mixed genders aged 21+. So this really gave everyone a perspective on how they could involve me to solve their specific problem. It made me relatable. However it locked the perception of me in to the example I was using.

Whatever it may be, it really gets the conversation off the ground as soon as people start asking questions. And if you ask me, this is how a good elevator pitch should be constructed! It should serve as a conversation starter that puts you into a well enough defined position.

At the beginning of my networking career, you could find me on so many different events. I couldn’t even count how many events I’ve attended, who invited me, and what type of people I have met there. My lack of focus became very obvious when someone commented on Facebook: “Mark is everywhere.” I know they did mean well.

I wanted to see sought after thought leaders while also reconnecting with people I already knew. What is it all about? Forums of forward thinking folks. No lamenting about the past. No club-centred talks all the time. Business aspect? Is it going to help my business out? Looking at this list it should be quite easy to check if an event fits your bill and the quality you’re after. I wanted to brand myself as a forward thinking businessman with an understanding of global issues and a solution based thinking using technology. So I’ve checked every invitation coming my way if it did have anything to do with the kind of branding I was after. Over time I got connected to many of the people occupying these spaces. And that at an accelerated pace when comparing it to my previous period of aimlessly attending each and every event.

If you’re a natural leader or someone burning for a certain topic, don’t be afraid to take the lead. It’s not always the easiest thing to do and yes, you can make mistakes along the way. People will be thankful, though, if someone took it upon them to get things moving and make things happen! That’s where you can fill the spot and take the leadership role on this matter. Be communicative. If something you don’t approve of keeps happening, talk about it gently and get it off your chest. It just hurts if you talk behind people`s backs. Your mentioning something can be the tipping point someone’s secretly been waiting for to get out of their heads as well. They were just biting their lips all the time. Pass your knowledge along. If it’s called for, you can contribute by sharing your insights. Give a talk / keynote speech. Involve others. George tells you about his need. You know Mary who can help George out? Involve Mary after you’ve asked George permission to do so. It will reflect positively on you for both George and Mary! Make things happen. Sometimes you’re the only way for someone to get their stuff in order. I’ve had this happen a number of times. A business quickly needed some good marketing materials and I had free spots on my schedule to create and ship them in time. Making things happen helped me and their business out.

Whatever that may be. Either you or your story were interesting enough that you kind of stuck or they think your business or what you do can contribute to anything they might need. Make it a point and reserve the time to say goodbye. That also means you need to prepare yourself.

Well, I’ve realised quickly that the people saying that networking is a waste of time, were the ones who didn’t really participate in events and rarely showed up to other gatherings of the group.

Remember, though, only if you show yourself can others get to know you and that’s the way opportunity presents itself to you and your business. Be present. Talk about yourself and your business. Closely listen to everyone else. Communicate your expectations.

I’m convinced that we all have our inspirations. We’re inspired by actions, ways of thinking and creations of other people. At least that’s what I’m experiencing. We socialize all the time and gravitate towards like minded people. The internet has brought us closer together. Everyone can express themselves freely and without any gatekeeper these days. Of course this makes for a lot of content in varying degrees of quality which permanently tries to gain our attention. In this piece I want to show you the people who inspired me most in 2016 and why. Some of them changed the way I produce my content, some of them inspired my thinking and all of them confirm a few things I’ve always known to be true.

Where to begin? I’ve been following your YouTube Channel ever since the Gizmodo 3 part series of your wildly functional studio came out. It was immediately clear to me that something like this studio would be useful for my purposes as well. The DIY touch everything has, the rawness yet functionality of your overhead shooting rig, just as one example; it’s all very inspiring and practical. So I’ll give you that at the very least. You’ve changed the way I think about many things especially in filmmaking. You’ve influenced the way I edit movies. Casey, you’ve made me start a YouTube channel on which I did 30 or so Vlogs until I realized how brutally unforgiving and hard it is to really get off the ground. It must be a pure grind every single day for you! I haven’t given up on the idea of a Vlog or the constant production of content so every opportunity I have to film something and make a movie out of it, I use. Thanks for that! Yes, I’m a bit jealous that you get to try out all the nerdy stuff before everyone else gets a chance but you’re a really hard working man. You need to let me in on two secrets, though: How do you manage to live a family life, being a celebrity and still maintain the business side of things. And I also need to know how your business is going. I’m currently also a product manager of an app so, there’s that.

Love how you make yourself vulnerable, accountable and clear all at the same time. You’re one of my inspirations as I also see the process in things.

The way you talk about tech opened my eyes that yes, there is emotion in #tech! I just had to see the glimpse of it. I was too filled with #fear to talk to you in person, though. I hope to meet you soon at another event. You’ve really inspired me to move back into tech again. I moved from product managing to the CTO role in a project the very next day. Thanks!

This band of four is best known by their latest internet phenomenon “Marble Machine” (26 million views on YouTube at the time of writing), which is a DIY built musical instrument using 2,000 marbles. What inspired me most and confirmed my belief in the “behind the scenes” culture of storytelling and showing that the world doesn’t only consist of events but mainly of processes leading up to events, is their meticulously crafted series of videos leading up to the big reveal of showing the world their marble machine. Martin spent a lot of time end effort in designing this machine and composed the music around it. In the end, though, these projects always are a team effort. I’ve got to give it to Wintergatan. They are hard working people bringing lovely and original music to the world using instruments they’ve built and designed themselves. Marcus Sjöberg, your style of drumming is really inspiring. If time permits, I’d be honoured if you could teach me some of your brilliant fills. Having been a drummer myself for 18 years now, I know it is hard work to build and maintain this playing style. In one of the other really astonishing pieces of art, entertainment and music “Sommarfågel” you’re using the kick and crash build-up. That’s back in 2013. It’s becoming a thing for me now in 2016.
