### I'm the catalyst to lead people on a purposeful pathway, so that growth, resources and opportunities are activated.

I'm a Team Performance Coach and Online Content Creator. I consistently contribute to international training events run by teams distributed across Europe. My activities range from producing one-week-long academies to managing them on-site or remotely, delivering training, or "just participating". I have experience in producing more than 300 videos, as well as applying agile methods in getting various startups from the first ideation to profitable operation.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\_inner\]\[/vc\_row\_inner\]\[vc\_message message\_box\_color="sky" icon\_type="pixelicons" icon\_pixelicons="vc\_pixel\_icon vc\_pixel\_icon-heart"\]Purpose | Connection | Growth | Diversity | Adventure\[/vc\_message\]\[vc\_tta\_accordion style="outline" active\_section="1465423477031-784ae8b3-6c4b" no\_fill="true"\]\[vc\_tta\_section i\_icon\_fontawesome="fas fa-tachometer-alt" add\_icon="true" title="Organisations I worked with" tab\_id="1465423189110-a352a7da-0fd4"\]\[vc\_column\_text\]Germany:
