Elevator pitch One of the most important ways to brand yourself and let people know what you do is your elevator pitch. So how do you make sure you can get your message across the right way? How can you start raking in those requests to be hired by the right people you can help best?</description></item><item><title>Branding through events (Networking Part 4)</title><link>https://cheret.de/2016/10/branding-through-events-networking-part-4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2016 21:58:58 +0000</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.de/2016/10/branding-through-events-networking-part-4/</guid><description>The types of events you attend shape your personal branding.
Events overload I know you’re part of at least one group that has something to do with networking. And you also get asked a lot to attend major or minor events.

I’ve had countless opportunities through this seemingly small but impactful gesture. On the surface it’s quite simple: Always say goodbye to everyone when you’re leaving an event! And I know that it’s more complicated than that. Give me a moment to explain, though. It will become essential in your networking toolkit.
Everyone&amp;rsquo;s so busy So you’ve been at this busy event and you only knew half of the people there.</description></item><item><title>Network strength (Networking Part 1)</title><link>https://cheret.de/2016/10/network-strength-networking-part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2016 09:53:25 +0000</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.de/2016/10/network-strength-networking-part-1/</guid><description>Your network strength is directly proportional to your contribution to it. I will go into more detail on how you can contribute to your network in coming articles on networking. But first I think it&amp;rsquo;s best to give you some thoughts on why I think your network is only as strong as your contribution to it. For the sake of simplicity, in this piece I&amp;rsquo;m going to stick to your local economic forum as an example for a network.</description></item><item><title>Inspirations 2016</title><link>https://cheret.de/2016/10/inspirations-2016/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2016 21:51:13 +0000</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.de/2016/10/inspirations-2016/</guid><description><![CDATA[I&rsquo;m convinced that we all have our inspirations. We&rsquo;re inspired by actions, ways of thinking and creations of other people. At least that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m experiencing. We socialize all the time and gravitate towards like minded people. The internet has brought us closer together. Everyone can express themselves freely and without any gatekeeper these days. Of course this makes for a lot of content in varying degrees of quality which permanently tries to gain our attention.]]></description></item><item><title>My take on the Brexit</title><link>https://cheret.de/2016/06/my-take-on-the-brexit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2016 21:04:11 +0000</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.de/2016/06/my-take-on-the-brexit/</guid><description><![CDATA[In the wake of the recent referendum of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s membership of the European Union which in short was just called &ldquo;Brexit&rdquo; for those in favour of leaving the EU, there has been a lot of buzz online and elsewhere. This of course was to be expected of a vote with the potential of having wide ranging consequences. I&rsquo;d like to call a lot of what&rsquo;s been going on merely &ldquo;noise&rdquo; while trying to distill the essence of it which I&rsquo;d like to call &ldquo;signal&rdquo;.]]></description></item><item><title>I have my domain back!</title><link>https://cheret.de/2014/06/i-have-my-domain-back/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2014 19:00:17 +0000</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.de/2014/06/i-have-my-domain-back/</guid><description><![CDATA[You may or may not know nominet. The .uk domain name registry in the United Kingdom, which was founded by Dr. Willie Black and five others on 14th May 1996 when its predecessor, the &ldquo;Naming Committee&rdquo; was unable to deal with the volume of registrations then being sought under the .uk domain.

These are &ldquo;Battlestar Galactica: Blood &amp; Chrome&rdquo; and &ldquo;Caprica&rdquo;. I decided to watch Caprica first and Blood and Chrome straight after that. As I recently finished watching &ldquo;Caprica&rdquo;, here&rsquo;s my write-up of thoughts on that particular show.
Background information The pilot episode of Caprica is set 58 years before the story of BSG and was released direct to DVD on 21st April 2009.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
